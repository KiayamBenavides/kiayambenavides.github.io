        Dinner
        <br><br>

        <b>Ingredients</b>
        <br>
        <ul><li>12 ounces spaghetti, fettuccine, or tagliatelle</li>
        <li>whole eggs</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces beef bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 to 2/3 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking the pasta)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup green peas (optional)</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li></ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <br><br>
        <b>Cook the Pasta:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add
        the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
        Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.
        <br><br>
        <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg
        yolks, freshly grated parmesan, and black pepper until smooth and well
        combined. Set aside
        <br><br>
        <b>Cook the Bacon:</b> In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the
        beef bacon with garlic and brown sugar until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
        Transfer the cooked bacon to a bowl on the side, leaving the bacon fat
        in the pan.
        <br><br>
        <b>Combine Bacon Fat with Egg Mixture:</b> Carefully pour the hot bacon
        fat into the bowl with the egg and parmesan mixture, whisking constantly
        to combine. Then, temper the egg mixture by slowly adding a bit of the
        reserved pasta water at a time until you get a creamy thick consistency,
        whisking to avoid scrambling the eggs. Don't add all the pasta water or
        your sauce will be too thin. You can always add more later.
        <br><br>
        <b>Cook the Carbonara:</b> Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the
        skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until the sauce
        thickens and becomes creamy. <b>Note:</b> Stir well and make sure the
        heat is not too high to prevent the sauce from curdling.
        <br><br>
        <b>Combine and Serve:</b> Add the cooked pasta back to the pan with the
        sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is well coated. Then,
        add the cooked bacon and green peas, mixing until well combined. Season
        with salt and additional black pepper to taste.Serve immediately with
        extra parmesan if desired. Enjoy!
